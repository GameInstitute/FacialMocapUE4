# Facial Mocap testing with the help of dlib library in Unreal Engine

Checking the possibility of further usage of this technology for my tasks.
The results are not very impressive.
Perhaps a fixed camera opposite the face and adding filters will give much better result.
But my task is much easier, that is why I will create more convenient solution based on Puppet.
I will surely share my results with you.
